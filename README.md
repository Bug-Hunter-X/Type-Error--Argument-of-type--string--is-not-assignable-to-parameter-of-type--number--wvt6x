# Type Error in TypeScript
This example showcases a common type error in TypeScript.  The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to call it with a string and number, which causes a type error.
The solution demonstrates how to use type guards or type assertions to handle potential type mismatches. 
This bug is important because it highlights the power of TypeScript's type system in catching errors early during development.
